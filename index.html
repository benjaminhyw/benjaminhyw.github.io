<!--Immediately underneat this is where I will include links for the navigation, but ideally I want it to look like a horizontal row of buttons maybe with drop down links.  For right now (2/17/16) Since I don't exactly know how to do that, I'll just include the html for links -->

Colorwise, I'm including the link to the color scheme I like here: "https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&rule=Complementary&selected=4&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=0.7,0.42250201449648184,0.30749698402590303,1,0.744973467301245,0.63928140575129,1,0.6742738868623952,0.53928140575129,0.23749698402590302,0.7,0.6313887632037609,0.2231063366089353,1,0.8847496486219512&swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4"
