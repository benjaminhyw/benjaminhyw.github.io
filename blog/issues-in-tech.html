	<h1>Diversity in Tech</h1>
	<h2>Sunday, March 6th 2016</h2>

	<p>Prior to joining DBC, I had heard of different types of issues within the tech field.  Often times diversity and gender were the topic of conversation.  While i'd listen in, I never really gave it much thought because I wouldn't see those issues in my immediate life simply because I was not involved in the tech world.  When I applied to DBC, I saw that I qualified for a small scholarsihp just due to the fact that I am Latino.  Pretty cool, I thought.  It did make me wonder however why that was the case.</p>

	<p>I just read an article on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/#4eace4a23577">Forbes</a> which basically addressed these issues.  The tech world seems to be predominately run by white and Asian males.  The article goes to say that in recent years, tech companies have indeed been trying to make an effor in changing that so the lack of diversity diminishes.  Companies have openly stated their plans and attempts to do so, causing other companies to hop on this train and make a difference.  What's interesting about this article however is that they say although the world COULD train more people in underreppresented groups, that's not where the issue lies.  The issue lies within the culture of tech companies.  They go on to say that unless something is done about that, we won't be seeing much change.</p>

	<p>When I found out I got a scholarsihp through DBC I was stoked!  $500, not huge, but hey!  $500 is a lot for me!  I don't really have much money under my name, still have financial support from my parents, making less money now to make time for school.. It's tough!  So those $500 are a blessing!  However if what the article goes to say is true .. although receiving aid from DBC is indeed very nice, there's still more to tackle.  This is a step, but not a solution.  I'm not sure exactly what would need to happen, seeing as how I literally know almost nothing about what it's like being in the tech field.. but I feel like the doors are slowly opening and we need to take advantage of that and give those doors a push!</p>

	<p>I saw a couple of links (<a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">information is beautiful</a>, <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/">WallStreetJournal</a>)that provided detailed breakdowns in recent years and it's true!  Even though these statements have been made, we haven't seen a whole lot of change!  An article on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/19/technology/diversity-chiefs-tech/"> CNN Money</a> says that while tech companies have made these announcements, it feels as if they're anouncements meant more for the public and the media than it is for the actual workforce.  <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters"> McKinsey&Company</a> goes on to say that although correlation isn't causation, there is indeed proof that more diverse workplaces are more likely to outperform!  So why is it that we still haven't seen a more drastic change?  Like the Forbes article mentioned, it has to do with the culture itself.    Hopefully we see bigger strides soon.</p>
