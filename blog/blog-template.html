How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was cool, my pair and I actually worked on both 2.6 and 2.7 together so we had a solid chunk of time working and it was cool.  We bounced ideas off each other and explained concepts that were fuzzy, plus having the ability to screen share was cool because we could show each other direct examples.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing is definitely helpful, but getting things to look like our image is hard when you're still learning the steps!  The HTML doesn't look much like the actual wireframe, we just have the basic parts in there.  I'm sure once we start to use CSS it'll look a lot more similar!

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe is something clear and easy to understand.  Essentials: Title, header, blog text content.  We also decided to have a relevant blog image before the bulk of the text, and a navigation bar on the left side to easily navigate through all of the different blog posts.  We included a search bar in case someone wanted to find something specific, and also included buttons for social media links at the bottom of the blog directory.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? My pair briefly explained what divs look like on a finalized version of a page, he used the Chase bank homepage.

Then, add a link to your wireframe image so your reviewers can see what it looks like.
