	<h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h4>Friday, April 1st 2016</h4>
    
    <p>I don't know about you, but every now and then when doing some research on Ruby online, i'd come across this thing called Ruby on Rails, or Rails for short.  Initially, way back when I was new to Ruby, i'd confuse the two when looking stuff up.  I'd end up reading some of the material.. some of it which LOOKED like it could make sense but just, wouldn't?  Anyone else?  No?  just me? Well, let's at least pretend we're on the same boat here..</p>
    <p>They're different, but similar!  Unlike the relationship between Java and JavaScript (the two are completely unrelated), Ruby and Rails are VERY much related!  Let's first start with a brief intro on what Ruby is.</p>
    <p>Ruby is an object-oriented language!  An object-oriented language is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.  An object can be a combination of variables, functions and data structures.  Essentially what this all means is Ruby is a language that uses variables functions and data structures.</p>
    <p>Ruby on Rails is a framework for building websites!  It's a software library that extends the Ruby programming language.  So basically, Rails uses the Ruby language by extending the scope of the language to allow it to work on websites!  Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server.  It's open source, which means it's free to use and as a user you're able to contribute to make it better!</p>
    <p>What's cool about Rails is the community it has!  Members create software libraries that make it easier to build complicated sites!  There's an informal network built on volunteerism within the community, one that thrives by offering support to one another!  Using Rails allows for easy collaboration among developers.</p>
    <p>You don't need to be a pro at Ruby to start leaning Ruby on Rails, you just have to feel comfortable.  It's not a language, its a website framework!  Some example websites created with Rails are <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu!</a>  So basically, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is pretty cool!</p>
