<h1>Arrays and hashes.. what are they?!</h1>
<h2>Sunday, March 6th 2016</h2>

<p>Simply put, both are lists of indormation!  You could think of arrays as being the more formal ones, as they index their information with numbers.  This just means slot 0 has some info, slot 1 has some info, slot 3 has some info, etc etc.  Hashes, however, are a little more open in terms of how information is stored.  So rather than being in an ordered list, you can assign the name to your key in they key/value pairs.  For example, slot "sour" could have the information "lemon juice", "sweet" cold have the information "candy", etc etc.</p>

<p>You might be wondering... how could you effectively use each type?
Essentially, they both kinda do the same thing so is it really all that beneficial to use one more so than the other?  The answer is yes!  Here's why.</p>

<p>Let's pretend you have a list of all of the movies you own.  For each title, you also have a very brief synopsys.  Your movie directory is ever growing so ... tell me about move 67!  Or maybe move 42?  How about movie 17!  You have no idea what movie i'm even referring to!  In THIS case, you'd want to use hashes!  Since hashes allow you to create your own key, it's much easier getting that information!  Now, wanna tell me about revenge_of_the_sith?  Makes a lot more sense than asking about movie 46, doesn't it ;]</p>

<p>Alternatively.. Let's say you have some information that doesn't necesarilly need to be assigned a specific key value.  Like.. a grocery list!  You have a list of items you know you need to purchase.. so what's the first thing on the list? [0] tomatoes!  Awesome, what's next? [1] oranges!  Cool, [2] bread ... got it etc etc.</p>

<p>Essentially, both of arrays and hashes are used for lists of information.  When you wanna be specific, use hashes!  You can assign key names to your liking.  When the key name isn't really all that necesary, go with arrays!</p>
