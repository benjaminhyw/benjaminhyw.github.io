	<h1>Ruby Hashes vs JavaScript Objects</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h4>Sunday, March 27th 2016</h4>
    
    <p>I decided to wear my GameBoy Color tank today, so let's talk video games.  Pikachu, I choose you!</p>

    <p>This year is Pokemon's 20th year anniversary!  Holy smokes!  Right now there are 721 confirmed Pokemon.. that's a lot of data!  Regardless of wether or not you've played the games or watched the show, all you need to know right now is that one of the tasks the main characters are given is to complete the "pokedex", this device that basically stores information on every encountered Pokemon.</p>
    <p>NOW I'M NOT SAYING I know how to make a pokedex.. but let's play with that idea using Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects!</p>
    <p>Both Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects are language specific ways to store information.  Hashes are lists of information where you can assign both the key name as well as the value.  This gives you a lot of flexibility.  JavaScript Objects are similar in terms of flexibility, but they do have a different notation.  Let's take a look.<p>

    <p>Here we see one way to write a hash and call upon specific values.  Now let's take a look at how we'd do the same with JavaScript Objects!</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/benjaminhyw/4ecf792c67bd70e48533.js"></script>
    <p>See what I mean?  Both of these contain the same information!  They're lists of data, but we create them differently.  The way we call on them is the same however, which is pretty cool.  Hope this helps!  Now I'm feeling nostalgic.. gotta catch 'em all!</p>
