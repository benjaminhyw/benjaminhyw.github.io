      <p>Wow has this been tough.  I hope some of y'all reading saw my old page, because that was the absolute worst!  MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS.. right??</p>

      <p>Alright so the thing with that last page was, I created something crazy simple because that's what I knew how to do.  We created that y'know pretty early on and DBC is my first real exposure to coding and all so I didn't really know how to go about it.. Looked at everyone else's and I mean I knew mine was terrible but once I saw everyone else's I was just in awe.  I honestly didn't update it regularly, but mostly because I knew I was gonna scrap the whole thing... So I didn't want to put in any time fixing something I knew I'd completely destroy to start brand new, you know?  I definitely should've scrapped it earlier and started working little by little rather than what I did here.. but it's done!  Sorta kinda, because I know there's no such thing when it comes to updating :P</p>

      <p>I had fun scrapping and starting over, because I felt free and already had some exposure.  This time, I spent more time with my wireframing.  Decided to draw it out rather than use the online wireframing tools and I had a much better experience doing so.  When it came to creating the actual pages, I had to do some research but that also came much easier now that I've practiced looking stuff up.</p>

      <p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I know there is definitely room for improvement.  As i'm typing this, I'm aware of certain things I need to edit.. but for now, this is okay..</p>

      <p>Alright Phase 1, gimme what you got!</p>
