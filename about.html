	<p>Hey everyone!</p>
	<p>Thank you for checking out my page!  A quick little blurb about me:  My name is Ben, I'm a 24 year old guy living in the beautiful SF Bay Area and I'm learning to code!  My entire life i've always used technology, now I wanna work with it!  This is something that I've always had an interest for, but only just recenlty decided to take the steps to learn the craft!</p>

	<p>Before I joined DBC, I was playing around with music and film.  I graduated UCSC with a degree in Film & Digital Media, so I played around with cameras a bunch.  I took on playing with music on the side, and still play with both here and there!  Life has taken me down a couple of different paths tho, so here I am.</p>

	<p>When I'm not blankly staring at my computer screen, I'm all over the place.  I like to explore, so on my free time you'll most likely catch me hiking through Muir Woods or something rather.  If it's sunny outside you'll catch me at the beach!  If I'm feeling lazy I might be playing video games, and if I'm just relaxing you might catch me Netflixin.  I like to dance, so occasionally you might catch me going out with friends.  I like to cook so if you're up for one mean vegetarian meal, get ready!  If you got a crazy idea, i'm probably up for it.  All of these things combined make me .. ME!</p>

	<p>If you're reading this, you're most likely doing so as part of one our assignments haha.  If we've already interacted, hello again!  If we haven't, hope we talk soon!  Thanks for checking this out.  This is nowhere near what I want my page to look like, but any comments are obviously more than welcome :]</p>
