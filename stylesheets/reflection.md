What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Well what I ended up doing for my website was a whole bunch of divs all over the place, so borders helped differentiate them visually.  Margins were used to create spacing between my divs.  Didnd't really play around with padding all that much, will try and do so later.  Essentially, the three just helped with configuring the basic layout of my divs.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned I have a hard time straying from what I feel comfortable with and that CSS positioning is a little hard for me.  I had to reference the 3.4 pair boxes to begin mine.  I created a whole bunch of id's, which I think worked ok.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The CSS coding was fine, placing things how I wanted them was hard.  Changing the div attributes was probably the easiest, so the color, height, width etc.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
It's a nice easy way to keep your html file looking clean!  Formatting with CSS allows for that to happen, plus it helped me with keeping CSS code in .css and HTML in .html.  Not having them both on the .html made coding elements less confusing.
